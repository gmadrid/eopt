### Things I want to do

- Transactions
  - only the sort that I want
  - only for a single stock
  - include totals
    - short-term vs long-term

- Portfolio view
  - full list 
  - options list
    - include stocks that have options
    - group by stock
    - (eventually, it would be nice to show which options match up or which stocks cover which options)
